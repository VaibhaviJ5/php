In PHP, conditions and loops are fundamental constructs for controlling the flow of execution in your programs. Here's a brief overview of how you can use them:

Conditions
1. if Statement

The if statement executes a block of code if its condition evaluates to true.

<?php

$age = 18;

if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
}
?>
