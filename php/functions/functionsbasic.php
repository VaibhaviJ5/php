<!-- 
functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks, and they can be reused throughout your script.
 Functions help organize your code, making it modular and easier to maintain.
 PHP provides several types of functions, and you can also define your own custom functions. -->


<!-- User-Defined Functions: Custom functions created to perform specific tasks.

Function Parameters: Functions can accept and handle parameters, including default values.

Returning Values: Functions can return values to the calling code.

Variable-Length Argument Lists: Functions can accept a variable number of arguments.

Anonymous Functions (Closures): Functions without names, often used as callbacks.

Callback Functions: Functions passed as arguments to other functions.

Class Methods: Functions defined within a class with access modifiers (public, private, protected).

Static Methods: Methods that belong to the class rather than an instance. -->
