PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It can be embedded into HTML and is used to create dynamic web pages. Here's a breakdown of some basics, definitions, and examples:

1. PHP Syntax
PHP code is embedded in HTML using 
<!-- < ? php ... ?>  -->
tags. The PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is sent to the client's browser.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <?php
        echo "Hello, World!";
    ?>
</body>
</html>
Explanation: In this example, 
<!-- < ? php ... ?>  -->
tags contain the PHP code, and echo is used to output the text "Hello, World!" to the browser.



syntax:
<!-- < ? php ... ?>  -->

2. Variables
Variables in PHP start with the $ sign and do not need explicit type declaration.
 PHP automatically determines the type of the variable based on its value.

Example:

<?php
    $name = "Alice";
    $age = 25;
    echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
    echo "Age: " . $age;
?>
Explanation: Here, $name is a string variable and $age is an integer variable. 
"." is used to concatenate strings in PHP.
